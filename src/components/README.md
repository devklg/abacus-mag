# Components Directory

This directory contains all the React components used in the project. Each component should be modular and reusable.

## Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks.
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Use a consistent naming convention (e.g., `ComponentName.js`).

## Example Components

- `Header.js`: The navigation bar and logo.
- `BinaryTree.js`: Visualization of the binary powerline.
- `SignUpForm.js`: The form for new users to join.
