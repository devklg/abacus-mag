# Utils Directory

This directory contains utility functions used throughout the app.

## Guidelines

- Keep functions small and focused on a single task.
- Write unit tests for all utility functions.
- Use descriptive names for functions.

## Example Functions

- `formatCurrency.js`: Formats numbers as currency.
- `validateForm.js`: Validates user input in forms.
